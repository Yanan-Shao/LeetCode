Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.
Table: Customers.
+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+

Table: Orders.
+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+

Using the above tables as example, return the following:
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+




// Sol 1
SELECT Name AS Customers FROM Customers 
WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT CustomerId FROM Orders);
 


// Sol 2
SELECT Name AS Customers FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.Id = Orders.CustomerId
WHERE Orders.CustomerId IS NULL;
 


// Sol 3
SELECT Name AS Customers FROM Customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Orders o WHERE o.CustomerId = c.Id);
