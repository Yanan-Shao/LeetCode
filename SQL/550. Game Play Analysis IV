Write an SQL query that reports the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.
 

drop table Activity 

Create table Activity(player_id int,device_id int,event_date date,games_played int); 

insert into Activity values(1,2,'2016-03-01',5);
insert into Activity values(1,2,'2016-03-02',6);
insert into Activity values(2,3,'2017-06-25',1);
insert into Activity values(3,1,'2016-03-02',0);
insert into Activity values(3,4,'2018-07-03',5);
