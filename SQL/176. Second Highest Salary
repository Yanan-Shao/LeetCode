Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.
+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the second highest salary is 200. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.



// Sol 1
SELECT Salary FROM Employee GROUP BY Salary
UNION ALL (SELECT NULL AS Salary)
ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
 


// Sol 2
SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee 
WHERE Salary NOT IN
(SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);
 


// Sol 3
SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee
Where Salary <
(SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);
 


// Sol 4
SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee E1
WHERE 1 =
(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(E2.Salary)) FROM Employee E2
WHERE E2.Salary > E1.Salary);
