drop table Activity 

Create table Activity(player_id int,device_id int,event_date date,games_played int); 

insert into Activity values(1,2,'2016-03-01',5);
insert into Activity values(1,2,'2016-05-02',6);
insert into Activity values(2,3,'2017-06-25',1);
insert into Activity values(3,1,'2016-03-02',0);
insert into Activity values(3,4,'2018-07-03',5);
