Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

| Id | Num |

| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |

For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.




// Sol 1
SELECT DISTINCT l1.Num FROM Logs l1
JOIN Logs l2 ON l1.Id = l2.Id - 1
JOIN Logs l3 ON l1.Id = l3.Id - 2
WHERE l1.Num = l2.Num AND l2.Num = l3.Num;


// Sol 2
SELECT DISTINCT l1.Num FROM Logs l1, Logs l2, Logs l3
WHERE l1.Id = l2.Id - 1 AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1
AND l1.Num = l2.Num AND l2.Num = l3.Num;



// Sol 3
SELECT DISTINCT Num FROM (
SELECT Num, @count := IF(@pre = Num, @count + 1, 1) AS n, @pre := Num
FROM Logs, (SELECT @count := 0, @pre := -1) AS init
) AS t WHERE t.n >= 3;
