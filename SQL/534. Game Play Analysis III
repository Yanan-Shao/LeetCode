Write an SQL query that reports for each player and date, how many games played so far by the player. That is, the total number of games played by the player until that date. Check the example for clarity.
 

drop table Activity 

Create table Activity(player_id int,device_id int,event_date date,games_played int); 

insert into Activity values(1,2,'2016-03-01',5);
insert into Activity values(1,2,'2016-05-02',6);
insert into Activity values(1,3,'2017-06-25',1);
insert into Activity values(3,1,'2016-03-02',0);
insert into Activity values(3,4,'2018-07-03',5);



// Sol
select a.player_id,a.event_date,sum(b.games_played) as games_played_so_far
from Activity a left join
Activity b
on a.player_id=b.player_id
and a.event_date>=b.event_date
group by a.player_id,a.event_date
order by a.player_id,a.event_date asc
